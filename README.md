## üéÆ Sentiment Classification of Steam Reviews using PySpark & Big Data

**Description:** This project focuses on classifying user reviews from the Steam platform using Big Data processing and machine learning techniques. The goal was to evaluate the performance of multiple classifiers in a distributed computing environment. I implemented and compared three machine learning models ‚Äî Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest ‚Äî to classify Steam user reviews into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The analysis was conducted in both local and distributed environments to highlight the scalability and efficiency of Big Data tools.

**Technologies & Tools Used :**
- Kaggle: Source of the user reviews dataset
- PySpark: For distributed data processing and machine learning model implementation
- Python: Core programming language for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud infrastructure for running distributed Spark jobs
- Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model development

## üõ°Ô∏è Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

**Description:** This project tackles the problem of automated phishing website detection using a variety of machine learning algorithms. The goal is to classify websites as legitimate or phishing based on their attributes and behaviors. I used the publicly available "Phishing Websites" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. After preprocessing the data, we trained and optimized multiple models, ranging from classic to advanced classifiers. These include: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). The models were evaluated using key metrics such as F1-score, ROC AUC, and cross-validation scores.

**Technologies & Tools Used:**
- Python: For all development and modeling
- scikit-learn (sklearn): Machine learning framework for model implementation and evaluation
- Google Colab: Cloud-based development environment for fast experimentation and collaboration
- Pandas / NumPy: For data handling and processing
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: For visualizations and metric analysis
