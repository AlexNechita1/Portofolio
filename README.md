## ðŸŽ® Sentiment Classification of Steam Reviews using PySpark & Big Data

** Description: ** This project focuses on classifying user reviews from the Steam platform using Big Data processing and machine learning techniques. The goal was to evaluate the performance of multiple classifiers in a distributed computing environment. I implemented and compared three machine learning models â€” Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest â€” to classify Steam user reviews into three sentiment categories: positive, neutral, and negative. The analysis was conducted in both local and distributed environments to highlight the scalability and efficiency of Big Data tools.

** Technologies & Tools Used : **
- Kaggle: Source of the user reviews dataset
- PySpark: For distributed data processing and machine learning model implementation
- Python: Core programming language for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud infrastructure for running distributed Spark jobs
- Jupyter Notebook: For exploratory data analysis and model development
